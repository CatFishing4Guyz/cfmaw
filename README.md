## CatFish's MAW
API Wrapper for Clash of Magic, named after the 5th dungeon in Link's Awakening (one of my favorite games), written in Python.

**Note: This is not an official thingy**

Visit the API here: https://api.clashofmagic.cc

There is also another wrapper written in TypeScript by Jelosus2 which you can find [here](https://github.com/Jelosus2/clashofmagic.js).
Don't bother though, mine is obviously better ;)

## Documentation
You can find it [here](https://github.com/Monkeys30/cfmaw/tree/main/docs/main.md).

There isn't much there at the moment. When I learn JavaScript or something I'll maybe build a website.

## Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/CatFishing4Guyz/cfmaw.git
cd cfmaw
pip install .
```

## Credits
Magic Man, for developing the API, a bunch of help, and pointing out stupid mistakes.

Jelosus2, pointing out stupid mistakes, suggestions.
